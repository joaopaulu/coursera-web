        <h2>The History of Fender</h2>
        <p>
          Fender Musical Instruments Corporation was founded in 1946 by Leo
          Fender, a visionary who changed the music world with his innovations.
          Since then, Fender basses have been favorites among musicians of all
          genres.

          The Fender Precision Bass, released in 1951, was the first solid-body
          electric bass in history, revolutionizing the way the instrument was
          played. The Jazz Bass, created in 1960, brought more versatility with
          its design and bright sound.
